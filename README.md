# DBMS-SQL
DBMS,SQL

This module provides a SQL interface to various database management systems (DBMS) using Perl's DBI module. It allows users to connect to different databases, execute SQL queries, and retrieve results in a consistent manner.
## Features
- Connect to multiple DBMS including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more.
- Execute SQL queries and commands.
- Retrieve results in various formats (array, hash, etc.).
- Handle database connections and disconnections.
- Support for prepared statements and transactions.
## Requirements
- Perl 5.10 or higher
- DBI module
- DBD drivers for the specific databases you want to connect to (e.g., DBD::mysql, DBD::Pg, DBD::SQLite)
## Installation
You can install the module via CPAN:
```
cpan DBMS::SQL
```
Or clone the repository and install manually:
```
git clone
git clone
cd DBMS-SQL
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
```
## Purpose of this Module
The purpose of this module is to provide a unified interface for interacting with different database management systems using SQL. It abstracts the underlying differences between various DBMS, allowing developers to write database-agnostic code. This is particularly useful for applications that need to support multiple database backends or for developers who want to switch databases without significant code changes.
